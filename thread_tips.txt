There are two modules which support the usage of threads in Python:
thread   (function like)
and 
threading (object orientated way)

Please note: 
    The thread module has been considered as "deprecated" for quite
    a long time. Users have been encouraged to use the threading module instead.
    So,in Python 3 the module "thread" is not available anymore. But that's not
    really true: It has been renamed to "_thread" for backwards incompatibilities
    in Python3.

    The module "thread" treats a thread as a function, while the module 
    "threading" is implemented in an object oriented way, i.e. every thread 
    corresponds to an object.
